Executive Summary:
- Problems: 	How to get items from DB for random sales
		How to track user purchase history
		Changing stock amounts based on purchases or removing from shopping cart
		
		How to generate recommendations based on user purchases/selection

		Basket uses sessionID, username and pid to identify what is in the shopping cart. To prevent duplicates
		each time the basket is cleared or sent to check out the sessionID is reassigned. 

		Price is determined by quantity * pprice, grand total determined at the end and taxes. 
		Keeping keys unique but linking to 
		
		When the session first start, pid and sale duration are stored to maintain consistency when returning to the home page

- List of Features
		Reccommendations for users based on demographic
		Purchase history
		Random item selection for big discount
		One JSP page that will represent the item selected.

- List of Assumptions:
		Not storing user sessions, must re-login and submit credentials for new sessionID.
		Warehouses around Canada, no international shipping
		No retail stores
		When you checkout it redirects to PayPal for payment processing
		Will ship to stored address from User Table.
